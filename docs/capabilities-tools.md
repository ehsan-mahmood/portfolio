## Capabilities & Tools

### Product & Systems Design
Designing software by working backwards from business intent, operational reality, and human constraints.

- Constraint-driven system design  
- End-to-end workflow and process modelling  
- Trade-off analysis under real operational pressure  
- Designing for operational variance, not ideal paths  
- Building feedback loops between systems and operators  

---

### Operational Systems & Workflows
Owning complex, stateful systems that must survive real-world failure modes.

- Long-running and resumable workflows  
- Back-order, exception, and recovery flows  
- Human-in-the-loop operational processes  
- Auditability, traceability, and system transparency  
- Debugging and stabilising live production systems  

---

### Backend & Integration
Building backend systems that prioritise correctness, clarity, and evolvability.

- API design for stateful and operational systems  
- Business rule isolation from execution logic  
- Integration with legacy and third-party systems  
- SQL-heavy transactional data modelling  
- Idempotency, consistency, and failure-aware design  

**Languages & Tools:** PHP, C++, Python (in progress), Node.js (in progress)

---

### Cloud & Infrastructure
Supporting production systems with pragmatic, reliability-first infrastructure.

- Production deployments and environment management  
- Understanding and designing for failure modes  
- Observability, logging, and operational visibility  
- Cost-aware infrastructure decisions  
- Incremental improvements to existing cloud systems  

**Platforms:** AWS (EC2, RDS, containerised services)

---

### Interfaces, Robotics & Physical Systems
Designing software that interfaces with humans, machines, and constrained environments.

- Workflow-first interface design  
- Interfaces for operational and constrained devices  
- Warehouse Management ↔ Control System integration  
- Robot coordination and telemetry fundamentals  
- Hardware–software boundary design  

**Tools & Frameworks:** Vue.js, ROS fundamentals, Gazebo simulation
