# Building Real-World Products & Systems

I build products and systems that operate in the real world — where software meets logistics, commerce, automation, and physical constraints.

My work sits across the full lifecycle: understanding a business problem, designing the system that solves it, and shipping something that people actually use under real conditions.

## Systems & Products I’ve Built and Worked On

### QR Code Menu & Ordering Platform (SMB SaaS)
**Problem:** Small restaurants needed a fast way to publish menus and accept orders without complex POS systems.  
**Constraint:** Non-technical owners, mobile-first usage, low tolerance for setup friction.  
**Outcome:** Designed a QR-based menu and ordering system focused on clarity, fast onboarding, and easy content updates.

**What I focused on:**
- Reducing setup to minutes, not hours  
- Designing menus that work in noisy, real environments  
- Balancing flexibility with simplicity for non-technical users  

This project pushed me deeper into product UX, merchant workflows, and customer adoption — not just implementation.

### Scheduling & Booking System for Service Businesses
**Problem:** Manual scheduling caused double bookings, missed lessons, and payment confusion.  
**Constraint:** SMS-heavy communication, instructor availability rules, tight margins.  
**Outcome:** Built a scheduler that aligned bookings, notifications, and payments into a single operational flow.

**Key product considerations:**
- Designing for operational edge cases, not happy paths  
- Understanding cost drivers (SMS, hosting, support)  
- Pricing the product based on unit economics, not features  

This project sharpened my thinking around sustainable SaaS pricing and operational cost control.

### Operational Software for Physical Commerce  
**Problem:** Digital systems often break down when they meet physical operations — inventory, packing, scanning, and human workflows.  
**Constraint:** Real-time decisions, imperfect data, and users working under pressure.  
**Outcome:** Designed systems that align software workflows with physical reality, reducing friction between digital intent and operational execution.

---

### Warehouse & Fulfilment Systems  
**Problem:** Packing and fulfilment logic became hard to change as business rules evolved.  
**Constraint:** Live operations, shared workflows, and zero tolerance for downtime.  
**Outcome:** Refactored tightly coupled logic into clearer, independently evolving systems that improved reliability and operational confidence.

---

### E-commerce Adjacent Workflow Automation  
**Problem:** Business teams needed faster iteration on fulfilment and order-handling rules without destabilising operations.  
**Constraint:** Legacy interfaces, stateful workflows, and integration-heavy environments.  
**Outcome:** Built abstractions that allowed rules to change without rewriting core flows, supporting faster experimentation at the business level.

---

### Robotics & Automation Exploration  
**Problem:** Consumer robotics projects often fail due to poor system integration rather than hardware limitations.  
**Constraint:** Limited compute, sensor noise, and real-world unpredictability.  
**Outcome:** Prototyped ROS-based systems and simulations to explore navigation, control, and system coordination in constrained environments.

## How I Approach Product & System Design

I start by understanding what the business is trying to achieve, then work backwards to the system shape.

In fulfilment systems, I often face the question: should complexity live in software or in process?  
Given high operational variance, I tend to push complexity into software where it can be observed, tested, and improved.

**Typical design decisions include:**
- Choosing explicit workflows over implicit behaviour
- Isolating business rules from execution logic
- Designing systems that fail visibly rather than silently

The trade-off is often more upfront design work, but it pays off in adaptability and trust.

## Designing for Humans in High-Friction Environments

Many of the users I design for are not “users” in the product sense — they are operators, staff, or customers trying to get something done quickly.

In warehouse and e-commerce operations, small UX decisions compound into real cost.  
A confusing scan flow or unclear error message doesn’t just annoy — it slows throughput.

By simplifying decision points and surfacing intent clearly, I’ve seen systems become faster not because they were optimised, but because people trusted them.

## Thoughts on Products, Systems & Automation

### Products Are Systems First  
Features matter less than how the system behaves under stress.

### Physical Reality Always Wins  
Inventory, robots, and humans don’t behave like clean data models — good products respect that.

### E-commerce Is an Operations Problem  
The best customer experiences are built on boring, reliable backend systems.

## What I’m Building Towards

I’m interested in products that sit at the intersection of:
- E-commerce and fulfilment
- Automation and robotics
- Marketplaces and real-world logistics

I’m particularly drawn to problems where software directly shapes physical outcomes.

## Let’s Build Something Meaningful

I enjoy working with people who care about shipping real products — not just writing code.

If you’re exploring ideas in e-commerce, automation, robotics, or operational software, I’m always open to thoughtful conversations and collaborations.
